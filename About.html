               <h1>About Me</h1>
               <p>My name is Afsane.I live in Iran currently.and I am graduated from Soore art University of
                   Tehran in cinema.during my education I made some trial and errors to find my path and I worked
                   in some places as an assitant editor or the editor and I realized what I lacked was sense of patience during the process
                   so I made the decision that i have to change my path .Although I had a very creative visual mind and I always 
                   play with the pictures and senses with musics in my head but that was not enough unfortunately.
                   so I directed myself into computer world .and so little by little i get interested in Javascript
                   so here I am .practicing my best to become a Web development or at the highest A full satck developer.
                   this is my dream to create better world for people with my ideas and I hope I soon become the one i always had in my mind.
                   So here is the works I did in both path .Hope yo like it :)
